  Test Case ID: #C-2-1
  Requirement ID/Description: C-2, Customers shall have a valid Address. A valid address must
    adhere to the Address model for validation requirements.
  Purpose: Verifies that a Customer can accept a valid Address object.
  Test Setup: Create an Address from a stub beforehand.
  Test Strategy: customer.setAddress() is passed the stub to see if an Exception is thrown.
  Input: Stub Address class, and valid Customer class input.
  Expected Output: The valid address stub as the customerâ€™s address does not throw an exception.
